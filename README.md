## What Are Type Guards?

Type guards are TypeScript features that help identify the specific type of a variable at runtime. They are particularly useful when working with variables that could have multiple types, allowing TypeScript to prevent potential errors by confirming the variableâ€™s type.

## Why Use Type Guards?

TypeScript is a statically typed language, which means it needs to know variable types to avoid errors before runtime. Type guards help the code determine the exact type of a variable, enabling safe and accurate use of specific properties or methods.

## Types of Type Guards

### 1. `typeof` Type Guard

Used to check simple types like `string`, `number`, and `boolean`. Ideal for situations where a variable could be one of a few primitive types.

### 2. `instanceof` Type Guard

Used to check if an object is an instance of a specific class. This is helpful when working with class instances and needing to confirm an object's type to access class-specific methods or properties.

### 3. `in` Type Guard

Used to check if an object has a particular property. This is useful when dealing with objects that share some properties but have unique ones that distinguish their types.
